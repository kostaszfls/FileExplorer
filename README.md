# Rust File Explorer

This is a simple file explorer implemented in Rust. It allows you to browse the files and directories in a specified disk and search for specific files or directories within it.

## Features

- Displays the contents of a selected disk drive
- Supports searching for files and directories based on a search term
- Recursively explores subdirectories

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. You can download it from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

2. Clone this repository or download the source code files.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Build and run the file explorer using the following commands:

   ```shell
   $ cargo build
   $ cargo run
Follow the prompts to enter the disk drive letter and the search term.
## Usage
Upon running the file explorer, you will be prompted to enter the disk drive letter (e.g., C, D, etc.) of the disk you want to search.

Next, enter the search term. The file explorer will display the files and directories that match the search term in the selected disk.

Directories will be indented to differentiate them from files. If a directory contains subdirectories, they will also be explored and displayed recursively.
